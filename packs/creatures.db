In a goblin clan, the war-chief is king, and his word is the law. As a result, goblins fear, respect, and envy their chiefs, which results in both total loyalty and murderous betrayal. A goblin war-chief must be careful to keep his berserkers and officers in line, lest they attempt to usurp him.</p>\n<p>Goblin war-chiefs, unlike goblin berserkers, will retreat if it is warranted, or if they can fall back to a strategic position or ambush. At worst, a goblin war-chief commands enough respect to rally his clan to make a counter-attack at a later date, but to not retaliate at all would certainly result in being cast down; as a result, any attack on a goblin clan is viewed as a personal insult to the war-chief.</p>\n<p>GMs running campaigns that feature goblins as primary antagonists shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to deviate from the stats presented here to give a war-chief Talents from the Character creation chapter in the 3e Core Rules, or to give them magic weapons and armour to help differentiate war-chiefs of different clans, or successors to previously killed war-chiefs. Even one Combat or Weapon talent can help give a goblin war- chief a lot of mechanical personality.</p>\n<h2>Goblin War-Chief Loot</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A goblin war-chief has on its person what it is equipped with, in addition to about 2d10 drakes worth of trophies weighing 1 ENC.</li>\n<li>A character can make a +0 Alchemy test to harvest a goblin ear, which is an Uncommon Destruction ingredient.

They are cheap for necromancers to produce since they do not require weapons like a skeleton; only some magicka and a corpse with most of its flesh intact.

A Draugr Scourge is a champion of melee combat, and a practitioner of the Thu'um, making them a deadly opponent to an unprepared adventurer. A Draugr Scourge excells at both duelling and fighting against groups, and is comfortable using a diverse set of weapons for different jobs. They can be thought of as being champion level Draugr, more than an even match for a heroic character.</p>\n<h2>Draugr Loot</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A group of Draugr often carry treasures worth a number of rolls on the Treasure Table determined by the GM.</li>\n<li>A character can harvest a Draugr's tongue, which is a Common Destruction ingredient.</li>\n</ul>","soul_energy":"300 White Soul","journal":"","notes":"","lucky_numbers":"","unlucky_numbers":"","supply":"1d2","supply_cat":{"1d2":"1d2","1d4":"1d4","1d6":"1d6","1d8":"1d8","1d10":"1d10"},"wealth":0,"current_enc":0,"carry_rating":{"current":0,"max":0,"bonus":0},"characteristics":{"str":{"value":45,"favored":false},"end":{"value":50,"favored":false},"agi":{"value":30,"favored":false},"int":{"value":20,"favored":false},"wp":{"value":45,"favored":false},"prc":{"value":30,"favored":false},"prs":{"value":5,"favored":false},"lck":{"value":null,"favored":false}},"proficiencies":{"combat":0,"magic":0,"evade":0,"observe":0,"stealth":0,"knowledge":0,"social":0,"physical":0},"hp":{"base":0,"current":0,"max":0,"temp":0,"bonus":0,"value":25},"action_points":{"current":3,"max":3},"luck_points":{"current":0,"max":0,"value":null},"stamina":{"current":0,"max":0,"bonus":0,"value":5},"magicka":{"current":0,"max":0,"bonus":0,"value":20},"xp":0,"wound_threshold":{"base":0,"bonus":0},"initiative":{"base":0,"bonus":0},"speed":{"base":0,"bonus":0},"size":"standard","size_cat":{"puny":"Puny","tiny":"Tiny","small":"Small","standard":"Standard","large":"Large","huge":"Huge","enormous":"Enormous"},"skill_ranks":{"untrained":{"name":"Untrained","rank":"","bonus":"","specialization":""},"novice":{"name":" (0) Novice","rank":"","bonus":"","specialization":""},"apprentice":{"name":"(1) Apprentice","rank":"","bonus":"","specialization":""},"journeyman":{"name":"(2) Journeyman","rank":"","bonus":"","specialization":""},"adept":{"name":"(3) Adept","rank":"","bonus":"","specialization":""},"expert":{"name":"(4) Expert","rank":"","bonus":"","specialization":""},"master":{"name":"(5) Master","rank":"","bonus":"","specialization":""}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"athletics":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"command":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"commerce":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"deceive":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"evade":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"investigate":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"logic":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"lore":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"navigate":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"observe":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"persuade":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"profession1":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","name":""},"profession2":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","name":""},"profession3":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","name":""},"ride":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"stealth":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"subterfuge":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"survival":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""}},"magic_skills":{"alchemy":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"alteration":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"conjuration":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"destruction":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"enchant":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"illusion":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"mysticism":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"restoration":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"necromancy":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""}},"talents":"<h2>Weapons and Armour</h2>\n<p><em>May have any:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Paired Ancient Nord Hero&rsquo;s War Axes:</strong> 2* 1d8 Splitting; UW, Magic, 2m.</li>\n<li><strong>Ancient Nord Hero&rsquo;s Greataxe (2h):</strong> 1d12 Splitting, UW, Shield Splitter, Magic, Concussive, 3m.</li>\n<li><strong>Ancient Nord Hero&rsquo;s Greatsword (2h):</strong> 1d12 Slashing, UW, Magic, Concussive, 3m.</li>\n<li><strong>Full Ancient Hero Armour:</strong> AR 6; 1 frost, Med.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ancient Nordic weapons and armour use the ENC values of Iron equipment.</p>\n<h2>Special Abilities</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Power Attack (1 SP): </strong>The Draugr can add his SB to the damage of a melee attack.</li>\n<li><strong>Cleave (1 SP): </strong>As part of a melee attack with a twohanded weapon, a Draugr Scourge can strike up to three targets in Reach as a single action.

They are generally encountered either naked or sparsely clothed, with visible wounds and openings rotted into their chest and abdomen.

They are cheap for necromancers to produce since they do not require weapons like a skeleton; only some magicka and a corpse with most of its flesh intact. Though able to move via magic, their rotted forms make them frail and weak. As such, they are often used by necromancers in swarms, overwhelming their foes in a horde of gouging digits and flailing appendages.</p>\n<p>Despite most being minions that lack individual strength, some zombies break this mold. Dread zombies are a particularly dangerous type of zombie. They are stronger, tougher, some say even smarter, than the average zombie. The magic that suffuses their being is also able to slowly heal any wounds acquired after their creation.

This can make spotting them hazardous, and in swampy regions, they sometimes swim on the surface of water, or drop down from trees. Snakes make semi-permanent burrows they range out of to hunt prey.

Giants are highly territorial and protective of their mammoths, and will often attack those who stray too near their encampments.

Purging rat dens is a quintessential adventurer&rsquo;s quest, and rat-killer is a perfectly reasonable career in large cities like Mournhold or Whiterun.</p>\n<p>Cave Rats are defensive in their dens, and aggressively raid settlements, typically during the night, for anything they can eat. When fought, rats tend to flee when they realize they are in danger, but they are just as likely to be suicidally courageous, throwing themselves at their opponent with reckless abandon without awareness the mortal danger they are in.</p>\n<p>When fought in their den, after fleeing rats will typically regroup for a cunning ambush later on.</p>\n<h2>Cave Rat Loot</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>On a +30 Survival test, a character can harvest one day's ration of rat meat.
