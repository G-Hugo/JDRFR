Giants are highly territorial and protective of their mammoths, and will often attack those who stray too near their encampments. In combat, giants use their massive strength to crush their enemies.</p>\n<p>Giants have demonstrated complex beliefs concerning death.

Their incorporeal nature make them dangerous to those in heavy armor, simply phasing through their opponent&rsquo;s armor with their ghostly claws. Along with their withering claws, wraiths are infamous for their fell magics. They have powers that can deaden flesh with cold, sap the energy from living creatures or steal their own voice.</p>\n<p>Perhaps deeper still are the gloom wraiths. While they have many similarities with wraiths, they are known to be much more dangerous due to their prowess with blade or claw and eldritch knowledge of magic. Their origin is not certain, but they most often appear to be wearing purple robes, the color of nobility, and are graced with crowns upon their heads.

Wild horses spook easily, and are very fast. Fighting wild horses is a rare occurence due to their preference to flee, but an angry horse is no laughing matter.</p>\n<p>In combat, a horse will trample its foes with its large, powerful hooves, or by charging and headbutting its foes before stomping on them when they are underfoot. A horse that is wrangled will buck and kick violently, and its not unheard of for errant stablehands to be brutally killed by their charges.</p>\n<p>For this reason, particularly angry or poorly tempered destriers are the preferred war horses of the peoples of Tamriel, though the horses themselves are as varied as man and mer alike. For example, the sleek horses of Hammerfell as thin and fast, their wide hooves ideal for travel on sand, and the hardy horses of Skyrim are large, shaggy coated, and muscular.</p>\n<h2>Horse Loot</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>On a +30 Survival test, a character can remove the horse's hide, worth 40 drakes, over the course of a Long Rest.

The character harvest DoS*3 days' rations of meat, which will spoil if not preserved.</li>\n<li>On a +0 Alchemy test, a character can remove and prepare the horse's hooves over a Short Rest.

At worst, a goblin war-chief commands enough respect to rally his clan to make a counter-attack at a later date, but to not retaliate at all would certainly result in being cast down; as a result, any attack on a goblin clan is viewed as a personal insult to the war-chief.</p>\n<p>GMs running campaigns that feature goblins as primary antagonists shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to deviate from the stats presented here to give a war-chief Talents from the Character creation chapter in the 3e Core Rules, or to give them magic weapons and armour to help differentiate war-chiefs of different clans, or successors to previously killed war-chiefs. Even one Combat or Weapon talent can help give a goblin war- chief a lot of mechanical personality.</p>\n<h2>Goblin War-Chief Loot</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A goblin war-chief has on its person what it is equipped with, in addition to about 2d10 drakes worth of trophies weighing 1 ENC.</li>\n<li>A character can make a +0 Alchemy test to harvest a goblin ear, which is an Uncommon Destruction ingredient.

Their culture is also primitive, and their dwellings are home to rotting carcasses, stripped bones, and the occasional shrine to Malacath, their patron. Ogres raiding settlements is far from unheard of, and often a legitimate concern for those in the frontier regions in Cyrodiil, though these raids most often end in stolen livestock rather than sacked villages.

Often, there are dozens, or hundreds of smaller spiderlings under the command of a larger mother spider, and her handful of mates. Capable of crawling on ceilings and walls, giant spiders weave powerful webs to entangle victims, who are then liquified with deadly poison and feasted upon. They will lie in wait to ambush larger prey, but are unafraid of charging weaker, man sized prey head on. The spiders can also use their deadly venom as projectiles, spitting it in large globs to weaken their prey from a distance.</p>\n<p>Though giant spiders are ambush hunters, desperation for food may drive them to take a more proactive approach to hunting, which may result in attacks away from their lair on the road, or in small villages. When attacked in their lair, spiders will use all of their abilities and defenses to their advantage to hinder their foes.</p>\n<h2>Giant Spider Loot</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>On a +30 Survival test, a character can remove the spider's hide, worth 30 drakes, over the course of a Short Rest.

They are generally encountered either naked or sparsely clothed, with visible wounds and openings rotted into their chest and abdomen.

They are cheap for necromancers to produce since they do not require weapons like a skeleton; only some magicka and a corpse with most of its flesh intact. Though able to move via magic, their rotted forms make them frail and weak. As such, they are often used by necromancers in swarms, overwhelming their foes in a horde of gouging digits and flailing appendages.</p>\n<p>Despite most being minions that lack individual strength, some zombies break this mold. Dread zombies are a particularly dangerous type of zombie. They are stronger, tougher, some say even smarter, than the average zombie. The magic that suffuses their being is also able to slowly heal any wounds acquired after their creation. Perhaps the most insidious feature of a dread zombie is a magical blight that infects its tissues called Astral Vapors.</p>\n<h2>Zombie Loot</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A character can attempt a +0 Alchemy test during a Short Rest to harvest a dose of Mort Flesh, which is an Uncommon Destruction ingredient.

A goblin war-chief is man sized or larger, and those of the nomad clans are even rumoured to be supernaturally protected. Some scholars speculate this to be some sort of blessing from Malacath made manifest, though it warrants further study.</p>\n<p>Goblin war-chiefs, as the highest-ranking members of a clan, have the best pick of the weapons, armour, food, durzogs, and mates, and they greedily hoard all of these. In a goblin clan, the war-chief is king, and his word is the law. As a result, goblins fear, respect, and envy their chiefs, which results in both total loyalty and murderous betrayal. A goblin war-chief must be careful to keep his berserkers and officers in line, lest they attempt to usurp him.</p>\n<p>Goblin war-chiefs, unlike goblin berserkers, will retreat if it is warranted, or if they can fall back to a strategic position or ambush. At worst, a goblin war-chief commands enough respect to rally his clan to make a counter-attack at a later date, but to not retaliate at all would certainly result in being cast down; as a result, any attack on a goblin clan is viewed as a personal insult to the war-chief.</p>\n<p>GMs running campaigns that feature goblins as primary antagonists shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to deviate from the stats presented here to give a war-chief Talents from the Character creation chapter in the 3e Core Rules, or to give them magic weapons and armour to help differentiate war-chiefs of different clans, or successors to previously killed war-chiefs.

At worst, a goblin war-chief commands enough respect to rally his clan to make a counter-attack at a later date, but to not retaliate at all would certainly result in being cast down; as a result, any attack on a goblin clan is viewed as a personal insult to the war-chief.</p>\n<p>GMs running campaigns that feature goblins as primary antagonists shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to deviate from the stats presented here to give a war-chief Talents from the Character creation chapter in the 3e Core Rules, or to give them magic weapons and armour to help differentiate war-chiefs of different clans, or successors to previously killed war-chiefs. Even one Combat or Weapon talent can help give a goblin war- chief a lot of mechanical personality.</p>\n<h2>Goblin War-Chief Loot</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A goblin war-chief has on its person what it is equipped with, in addition to about 2d10 drakes worth of trophies weighing 1 ENC.</li>\n<li>A character can make a +0 Alchemy test to harvest a goblin ear, which is an Uncommon Destruction ingredient.
