A goblin war-chief is man sized or larger, and those of the nomad clans are even rumoured to be supernaturally protected. Some scholars speculate this to be some sort of blessing from Malacath made manifest, though it warrants further study.</p>\n<p>Goblin war-chiefs, as the highest-ranking members of a clan, have the best pick of the weapons, armour, food, durzogs, and mates, and they greedily hoard all of these. In a goblin clan, the war-chief is king, and his word is the law. As a result, goblins fear, respect, and envy their chiefs, which results in both total loyalty and murderous betrayal. A goblin war-chief must be careful to keep his berserkers and officers in line, lest they attempt to usurp him.</p>\n<p>Goblin war-chiefs, unlike goblin berserkers, will retreat if it is warranted, or if they can fall back to a strategic position or ambush. At worst, a goblin war-chief commands enough respect to rally his clan to make a counter-attack at a later date, but to not retaliate at all would certainly result in being cast down; as a result, any attack on a goblin clan is viewed as a personal insult to the war-chief.</p>\n<p>GMs running campaigns that feature goblins as primary antagonists shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to deviate from the stats presented here to give a war-chief Talents from the Character creation chapter in the 3e Core Rules, or to give them magic weapons and armour to help differentiate war-chiefs of different clans, or successors to previously killed war-chiefs.

A goblin war-chief is man sized or larger, and those of the nomad clans are even rumoured to be supernaturally protected. Some scholars speculate this to be some sort of blessing from Malacath made manifest, though it warrants further study.</p>\n<p>Goblin war-chiefs, as the highest-ranking members of a clan, have the best pick of the weapons, armour, food, durzogs, and mates, and they greedily hoard all of these. In a goblin clan, the war-chief is king, and his word is the law. As a result, goblins fear, respect, and envy their chiefs, which results in both total loyalty and murderous betrayal. A goblin war-chief must be careful to keep his berserkers and officers in line, lest they attempt to usurp him.</p>\n<p>Goblin war-chiefs, unlike goblin berserkers, will retreat if it is warranted, or if they can fall back to a strategic position or ambush. At worst, a goblin war-chief commands enough respect to rally his clan to make a counter-attack at a later date, but to not retaliate at all would certainly result in being cast down; as a result, any attack on a goblin clan is viewed as a personal insult to the war-chief.</p>\n<p>GMs running campaigns that feature goblins as primary antagonists shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to deviate from the stats presented here to give a war-chief Talents from the Character creation chapter in the 3e Core Rules, or to give them magic weapons and armour to help differentiate war-chiefs of different clans, or successors to previously killed war-chiefs.

They typically lack the drive or motive to attack settlements, but under the command of a Draugr Lord they may become a roaming, aggressive force that needs no food, rest, or medicine.</p>\n<p>When encountered in their burial grounds, Draugr will fight ferociously, but will also not hesitate to retreat to better positions, or go to warn the rest of the undead garrison.</p>\n<p>Draugr are intelligent undead, and as such can plan and strategize, though their greater faculties have mostly been drained away over the centuries, leaving them primitive and easily fooled. However, in the presence of a greater Draugr, even the lowest thralls of the Dragons become something to be feared.</p>\n<h2>Draugr Loot</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A group of Draugr often carry treasures worth a number of rolls on the Treasure Table determined by the GM.</li>\n<li>A character can harvest a Draugr's tongue, which is a Common Destruction ingredient.</li>\n</ul>","soul_energy":"150 White Soul","journal":"","notes":"","lucky_numbers":"","unlucky_numbers":"","supply":"1d2","supply_cat":{"1d2":"1d2","1d4":"1d4","1d6":"1d6","1d8":"1d8","1d10":"1d10"},"wealth":0,"current_enc":0,"carry_rating":{"current":0,"max":24,"bonus":0},"characteristics":{"str":{"value":45,"favored":false},"end":{"value":40,"favored":false},"agi":{"value":30,"favored":false},"int":{"value":10,"favored":false},"wp":{"value":25,"favored":false},"prc":{"value":30,"favored":false},"prs":{"value":5,"favored":false},"lck":{"value":null,"favored":false}},"proficiencies":{"combat":0,"magic":0,"evade":0,"observe":0,"stealth":0,"knowledge":0,"social":0,"physical":0},"hp":{"base":20,"current":0,"max":20,"temp":0,"bonus":0,"value":20},"action_points":{"current":3,"max":3},"luck_points":{"current":0,"max":0,"value":null},"stamina":{"current":0,"max":4,"bonus":0,"value":4},"magicka":{"current":0,"max":10,"bonus":0,"value":10},"xp":0,"wound_threshold":{"base":10,"bonus":0},"initiative":{"base":7,"bonus":0},"speed":{"base":10,"bonus":0},"size":"standard","size_cat":{"puny":"Puny","tiny":"Tiny","small":"Small","standard":"Standard","large":"Large","huge":"Huge","enormous":"Enormous"},"skill_ranks":{"untrained":{"name":"Untrained","rank":"","bonus":"","specialization":""},"novice":{"name":" (0) Novice","rank":"","bonus":"","specialization":""},"apprentice":{"name":"(1) Apprentice","rank":"","bonus":"","specialization":""},"journeyman":{"name":"(2) Journeyman","rank":"","bonus":"","specialization":""},"adept":{"name":"(3) Adept","rank":"","bonus":"","specialization":""},"expert":{"name":"(4) Expert","rank":"","bonus":"","specialization":""},"master":{"name":"(5) Master","rank":"","bonus":"","specialization":""}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"athletics":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"command":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"commerce":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"deceive":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"evade":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"investigate":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"logic":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"lore":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"navigate":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"observe":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"persuade":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"profession1":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","name":""},"profession2":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","name":""},"profession3":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","name":""},"ride":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"stealth":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"subterfuge":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"survival":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""}},"magic_skills":{"alchemy":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"alteration":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"conjuration":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"destruction":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"enchant":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"illusion":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"mysticism":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"restoration":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"necromancy":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""}},"talents":"<h2>Weapons and Armour</h2>\n<p><em>May have one of:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ancient Nordic War Axe:</strong> 1d8 Splitting; UW, 2m.</li>\n<li><strong>Ancient Nordic Broadsword:</strong> 1d8 Slashing, 2m.</li>\n<li><strong>Ancient Nordic Mace:</strong> 1d8 Crushing; UW, 2m.</li>\n<li><strong>Ancient Nordic Spear (1.5H):</strong> 1d8 (1d10), Impaling; UW, 2-3m.</li>\n<li><strong>Ancient Nordic Shortbow:</strong> 1d6, Reload (1), 20/100/200m.

They are generally encountered either naked or sparsely clothed, with visible wounds and openings rotted into their chest and abdomen.

They are cheap for necromancers to produce since they do not require weapons like a skeleton; only some magicka and a corpse with most of its flesh intact.

As such, they are often used by necromancers in swarms, overwhelming their foes in a horde of gouging digits and flailing appendages.</p>\n<p>Despite most being minions that lack individual strength, some zombies break this mold. Dread zombies are a particularly dangerous type of zombie. They are stronger, tougher, some say even smarter, than the average zombie.

They can be thought of as being champion level Draugr, more than an even match for a heroic character.</p>\n<h2>Draugr Loot</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A group of Draugr often carry treasures worth a number of rolls on the Treasure Table determined by the GM.</li>\n<li>A character can harvest a Draugr's tongue, which is a Common Destruction ingredient.</li>\n</ul>","soul_energy":"300 White Soul","journal":"","notes":"","lucky_numbers":"","unlucky_numbers":"","supply":"1d2","supply_cat":{"1d2":"1d2","1d4":"1d4","1d6":"1d6","1d8":"1d8","1d10":"1d10"},"wealth":0,"current_enc":0,"carry_rating":{"current":0,"max":26,"bonus":0},"characteristics":{"str":{"value":45,"favored":false},"end":{"value":50,"favored":false},"agi":{"value":30,"favored":false},"int":{"value":20,"favored":false},"wp":{"value":45,"favored":false},"prc":{"value":30,"favored":false},"prs":{"value":5,"favored":false},"lck":{"value":null,"favored":false}},"proficiencies":{"combat":0,"magic":0,"evade":0,"observe":0,"stealth":0,"knowledge":0,"social":0,"physical":0},"hp":{"base":25,"current":0,"max":25,"temp":0,"bonus":0,"value":25},"action_points":{"current":3,"max":3},"luck_points":{"current":0,"max":0,"value":null},"stamina":{"current":0,"max":5,"bonus":0,"value":5},"magicka":{"current":0,"max":20,"bonus":0,"value":20},"xp":0,"wound_threshold":{"base":13,"bonus":0},"initiative":{"base":8,"bonus":0},"speed":{"base":10,"bonus":0},"size":"standard","size_cat":{"puny":"Puny","tiny":"Tiny","small":"Small","standard":"Standard","large":"Large","huge":"Huge","enormous":"Enormous"},"skill_ranks":{"untrained":{"name":"Untrained","rank":"","bonus":"","specialization":""},"novice":{"name":" (0) Novice","rank":"","bonus":"","specialization":""},"apprentice":{"name":"(1) Apprentice","rank":"","bonus":"","specialization":""},"journeyman":{"name":"(2) Journeyman","rank":"","bonus":"","specialization":""},"adept":{"name":"(3) Adept","rank":"","bonus":"","specialization":""},"expert":{"name":"(4) Expert","rank":"","bonus":"","specialization":""},"master":{"name":"(5) Master","rank":"","bonus":"","specialization":""}},"skills":{"acrobatics":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"athletics":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"command":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"commerce":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"deceive":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"evade":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"investigate":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"logic":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"lore":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"navigate":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"observe":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"persuade":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"profession1":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","name":""},"profession2":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","name":""},"profession3":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":"","name":""},"ride":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"stealth":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"subterfuge":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"survival":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""}},"magic_skills":{"alchemy":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"alteration":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"conjuration":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"destruction":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"enchant":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"illusion":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"mysticism":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"restoration":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""},"necromancy":{"rank":"","bonus":0,"specialization":""}},"talents":"<h2>Weapons and Armour</h2>\n<p><em>May have any:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Paired Ancient Nord Hero&rsquo;s War Axes:</strong> 2* 1d8 Splitting; UW, Magic, 2m.</li>\n<li><strong>Ancient Nord Hero&rsquo;s Greataxe (2h):</strong> 1d12 Splitting, UW, Shield Splitter, Magic, Concussive, 3m.</li>\n<li><strong>Ancient Nord Hero&rsquo;s Greatsword (2h):</strong> 1d12 Slashing, UW, Magic, Concussive, 3m.</li>\n<li><strong>Full Ancient Hero Armour:</strong> AR 6; 1 frost, Med.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ancient Nordic weapons and armour use the ENC values of Iron equipment.</p>\n<h2>Special Abilities</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Power Attack (1 SP): </strong>The Draugr can add his SB to the damage of a melee attack.</li>\n<li><strong>Cleave (1 SP): </strong>As part of a melee attack with a twohanded weapon, a Draugr Scourge can strike up to three targets in Reach as a single action.

A goblin war-chief is man sized or larger, and those of the nomad clans are even rumoured to be supernaturally protected. Some scholars speculate this to be some sort of blessing from Malacath made manifest, though it warrants further study.</p>\n<p>Goblin war-chiefs, as the highest-ranking members of a clan, have the best pick of the weapons, armour, food, durzogs, and mates, and they greedily hoard all of these. In a goblin clan, the war-chief is king, and his word is the law. As a result, goblins fear, respect, and envy their chiefs, which results in both total loyalty and murderous betrayal. A goblin war-chief must be careful to keep his berserkers and officers in line, lest they attempt to usurp him.</p>\n<p>Goblin war-chiefs, unlike goblin berserkers, will retreat if it is warranted, or if they can fall back to a strategic position or ambush. At worst, a goblin war-chief commands enough respect to rally his clan to make a counter-attack at a later date, but to not retaliate at all would certainly result in being cast down; as a result, any attack on a goblin clan is viewed as a personal insult to the war-chief.</p>\n<p>GMs running campaigns that feature goblins as primary antagonists shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to deviate from the stats presented here to give a war-chief Talents from the Character creation chapter in the 3e Core Rules, or to give them magic weapons and armour to help differentiate war-chiefs of different clans, or successors to previously killed war-chiefs.

Giants speak in a deep, gutteral language that no one since the days of Atmora remembers how to speak. They wear clothing made of furs and bones. A giant&rsquo;s tools and weapons are often made from oversized rock, logs, and scrimshawed mammoth bones.</p>\n<p>Giants stand 11-12 feet tall, and female giants are rarely, if ever, seen. It is speculated that female giants are kept living in the mountains while the nomadic males range about during the summer months, only to return to the mountaintops in winter after having grazed their mammoth herds for the season, which they have domesticated and shepherd. Giants are highly territorial and protective of their mammoths, and will often attack those who stray too near their encampments. In combat, giants use their massive strength to crush their enemies.</p>\n<p>Giants have demonstrated complex beliefs concerning death. When a giant is sick or dying, they make pilgrimage to one of their sacred burial grounds to die alone.</p>\n<h2>Giant Loot</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A character can salvage Mammoth Cheese from the giant's pouch.
